Apache UserALE.PyQt5 intercepts all application events by letting the developer install an event filter in their PyQt5 application to generate detailed user logs. Apache UserALE.PyQt5 does not capture system level logs or events generated by a non-user (a.k.a. system and signals sent between QObjects).

### Apache UserALE.PyQt5

>
```python
class userale.ale.Ale(output='userale.log', user=None,
session=None, toolname=None, toolversion=None,
keylog=False, interval=5000, resolution=100, shutoff=[])
```

> **Bases:** PyQt5.QtCore.QObject

> **Parameters:**
- output – [str] The file or url path to which logs will be sent
- user – [str] Identifier for the user of the application
- session – [str] Session tag to track same user with multiple sessions. If a session is not provided, one will be created
- toolname – [str] The application name
- toolversion – [str] The application version
- keylog – [bool] Should detailed key logs be recorded. Default is False
- interval – [int] The minimum time interval in ms between batch transmission of logs. Default is 5000ms.
- resolution – [int] Delay in ms between instances of high frequency logs like mousemoves, scrolls, etc. Default is 100ms (10Hz).
- shutoff – [list] Turn off logging for specific events

An example log will appear like this:

  ```javascript
  {
      'target': 'testLineEdit',
      'path': ['Example', 'testLineEdit'],
      'clientTime': '2016-08-03 16:12:03.460573',
      'location': {'x': 82, 'y': 0},
      'type': 'mousemove',
      'userAction': 'true',
      'details' : {},
      'userId': 'userABC1234',
      'session': '5ee42ccc-852c-44d9-a937-28d7901e4ead',
      'toolName': 'myApplication',
      'toolVersion': '3.5.0',
      'useraleVersion': '0.1.0'
  }
  ```

#### aggregate()
Sample high frequency logs at self.resolution. High frequency logs are consolidated down to a single log event to be emitted later

#### cleanup()
Clean up any dangling logs in self.logs or self.hlogs

#### dump()
Write log data to file

#### eventFilter(object, event)
Filters events for the watched widget.

> **Parameters:**
- object – [QObject] The object being watched.
- event – [QEvent] The event triggered by a user action.

> **Returns:**
- [bool] Propagate filter up if other objects needs to be handled

#### getClientTime()
Capture the time the event was captured in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC)

> **Returns:**
- [str] String representation of the time the event was captured.

#### getLocation(event)
Grab the x and y position of the mouse cursor, relative to the widget that received the event.

> **Parameters:**
- event – [QEvent] The base class for all event classes.

> **Returns:**
- [dict] A dictionary representation of the x and y positions of the mouse cursor.

#### getPath(object)
Generate the entire object hierachy from root to leaf node.

> **Parameters:**
- object – [QObject] The base class for all Qt objects.

> **Returns:**
- [list] List of QObjects.

#### getSelector(object)
Get target object’s name (object defined by user or object’s meta class name).

> **Parameters:**
- object – [QObject] The base class for all Qt objects.

> **Returns:**
- [str] The Qt object’s name

#### getSender(object)
Fetch the QObject who triggered the event

> **Parameters:**
- object – [QObject] The object being watched.

> **Returns:**
- [QObject] The QObject

#### handleDragEvents(event_type, event, object)
Returns the userale log representing all drag events.

- event – [QEvent] The base class for all event classes.
- object – [QObject] The base class for all Qt objects.

> **Returns:**
- [dict] A userale log describing a drag event.

#### handleKeyEvents(event_type, event, object)
Returns the userale log representing all key events, including key name and key code.

> **Parameters:**

- event – [QEvent] The base class for all event classes.
- object – [QObject] The base class for all Qt objects.

> **Returns:**
- [dict] A userale log describing a key event.

#### handleMouseEvents(event_type, event, object)
Returns the userale log representing all mouse event data.

> **Parameters:**
