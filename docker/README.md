How to Build SensSoft Docker Containers
=======================================

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Install [``Docker``](http://docker.com) on your machine. Requires Docker 1.7 and above.

1. Install docker-compose. Full instructions can be found [``here``](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

1. Create docker-machine instance
   ```bash
   docker-machine create --virtualbox-memory 3072 --virtualbox-cpu-count 2 senssoft
   ```

1. Before launching the Docker containers, ensure your ``vm_max_map_count``
   kernel setting is set to at least 262144.
   Visit [``Running Elasticsearch in Production mode``](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode) for OS specific instructions.

   ```bash
   # Example for Linux systems
   $ docker-machine ssh senssoft sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```

1. Create externel docker network to enable system monitoring. Only enable if running 
   the Elasticsearch 6.2.2 configuration (single and cluster mode)
   
   ```bash
   $ docker network create esnet
   ```

Single Node Deployment
----------------------

1. Start Elasticsearch 5.6.3 or 6.2.2. Give Elasticsearch about 1-2 minutes to start before confirming
   its state.
   
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.single-5.6.3.yml up -d elasticsearch

   or

   $ docker-compose up -d elasticsearch
   ```

1. Confirm state:
   ```bash
   $ docker-machine ssh senssoft curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
    {
      "cluster_name" : "SensSoft",
      "status" : "yellow",
      "timed_out" : false,
      "number_of_nodes" : 1,
      "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
      "active_primary_shards" : 0,
      "active_shards" : 0,
      "relocating_shards" : 0,
      "initializing_shards" : 0,
      "unassigned_shards" : 0,
      "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
      "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
      "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
      "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
      "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 100.0
    }
   ```
 
1. Launch logging server. Give Logstash about 2 minutes to start before confirming 
   its state.
  
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d logstash
   $ docker-machine ssh senssoft curl -XGET http://localhost:8100 
   ok
   ```
   
1. Before Kibana can be used, we will need to generate some data. We have already 
   provided an example instrumented website to assist.
   
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d site
   $ ssh docker@$(docker-machine ip senssoft) -L 8080:localhost:8080
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:8080` and you will see Apache SensSoft's home page.
   
1. Launch Kibana. Give Kibana about 2-5 minutes to start before accessing
   `http://localhost:5601`. 
   
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d kibana
   $ ssh docker@$(docker-machine ip senssoft) -L 5601:localhost:5601
   ```

1. Register an index in Kibana to see the logs:

   Goto: Management -> Index Patterns and enter `userale` in the Index pattern box.
   Choose `clientTime` in the drop down `Time Filter field name` field.
  
   ![alt text][configure_index]
   
1. Load example Dashboard and Visualizations under docker/kibana/.

   Goto: Management -> Saved Objects and select the `Import` button. Import the
   `visualizations.json` and `dashboard.json` file.

   ![alt text][management]

   Confirm index conflicts if message appears. 
   
   ![alt text][confirmation]
   
   Once that is complete, navigate to the `Dashboard` view in Kibana and click the
   `Apache SensSoft Dashboard` object. 

   ![alt text][dashboard]

1. To Launch Tap and Distill
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d distill tap
   ```
   
1. To stop all containers.
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose stop
    ```

Multi-Node Deployment on a Single Machine
-----------------------------------------

1. Install [``Docker``](http://docker.com) on your machine. Require Docker 1.7 and above.

1. Install ``docker-compose`` in an virtual environment. Full instructions can be found [``here``](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

1. Create docker-machine instance
   ```bash
   docker-machine create --virtualbox-memory 2048 --virtualbox-cpu-count 2 senssoft
   ```

1. Before launching the Docker containers, ensure your ``vm_max_map_count``
   kernel setting is set to at least 262144.
   Visit [``Running Elasticsearch in Production mode``](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode) for OS specific instructions.

   ```bash
   # Example for Linux systems
   $ docker-machine ssh senssoft sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```

1. Create externel docker network to enable system monitoring. Only enable if running 
   the Elasticsearch 6.2.2 configuration (single and cluster mode)
   
   ```bash
   $ docker network create esnet
   ```

1. Start Elasticsearch cluster:

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.cluster.yml up -d --scale elasticsearch=3 elasticsearch
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.cluster.yml up -d loadbalancer
    ```

    The loadbalancer node exposes port 9200 on localhost and is the only node
    that has HTTP enabled. Services such as Kibana and Logstash connect to the
    loadbalancer node directly. Loadbalancer accepts requests from Kibana and Logstash
    and balances them across the elasticsearch worker nodes. The elasticsearch
    worker nodes communicate to each other and the loadbalancer via TCP on port 9300.

    <aside class="warning">
    Starting an elasticsearch cluster is not recommended on a single server. This
    is just for demonstration purposes only. Please refer to our [Kubernetes] guide to
    deploy an Elasticsearch cluster.
    </aside>

1. Confirm cluster state:
   ```bash
   $ docker-machine ssh senssoft curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health\?pretty
    {
     "cluster_name" : "SensSoft",
     "status" : "green",
     "timed_out" : false,
     "number_of_nodes" : 4,
     "number_of_data_nodes" : 3,
     "active_primary_shards" : 0,
     "active_shards" : 0,
     "relocating_shards" : 0,
     "initializing_shards" : 0,
     "unassigned_shards" : 0,
     "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
     "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
     "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
     "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
     "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 100.0
   }
   ```
   Confirm that the `number_of_nodes` is 4 and `number_of_data_nodes` is 3.

1. Follow remaining instructions in [Single Node Deployment] starting at #6.

Having Issues?
--------------
1. Check out the docker-compose logs for the service(s) that are having issues.

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose ps 
   ```
1. Make sure to send us the docker-compose logs to help diagnose your issues please!
