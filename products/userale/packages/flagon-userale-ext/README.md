# Flagon UserALE Browser Extension

This package provides a browser extension for [Flagon UserALE](https://flagon.apache.org/userale/), enabling effortless, no-code instrumentation of websites. It captures user interactions and sends behavioral logs to a logging endpoint.

The extension is built with [Plasmo](https://docs.plasmo.com/) and supports modern browser environments like Chrome and Firefox.

## Features

âœ… Passive user interaction logging  
âœ… No code changes required on instrumented pages  
âœ… Configurable via extension options (logging endpoint, user ID, tool metadata)  
âœ… Supports local development and custom deployments
