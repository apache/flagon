Contributing to Apache Flagon Distill
-------------------------------
##TO DO: Update for WIP-Package

Thank you for contributing to the Distill project!

There are certain procedures that must be followed for all contributions. These
procedures are necessary to allow us to allocate resources for reviewing and
testing your contribution, as well as to communicate effectively with you during
the review process.

1) Create an issue in JIRA

    All changes to Distill must have a corresponding issue in JIRA so the
    change can be properly tracked:

        https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/senssoft

    If you do not already have an account on JIRA, you will need to create
    before creating your new issue.

2) Make and test your changes locally

    The Distill source is maintained in a git repository hosted on Apache:

        https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-senssoft-distill.git

    To make your changes, fork the repository and make commits
    to a topic branch in your fork. Commits should be made in logical units
    and must reference the JIRA issue number:

    ::
    
    	$ git commit -m "#SENSSOFT-123: #High-level message describing the changes."

    Avoid commits which cover multiple, distinct goals that could (and should)
    be handled separately.

    If you do not already have an account on JIRA, you will need to create
    one before making your changes.

3) Submit your changes via a pull request on Git

    Once your changes are ready, submit them by creating a pull request for
    the corresponding topic branch you created when you began working on your
    changes.

    The Apache SensSoft team will then review your changes and, if they pass review,
    your changes will be merged.
