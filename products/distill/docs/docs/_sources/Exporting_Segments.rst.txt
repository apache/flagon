==================
Exporting Segments
==================
``Segments`` objects can be exported into csv files for further analysis.  Distill provides a simple function to do this:
``export_segments``.  This function will take in the path to place the new file along with a ``Segments`` object and output
a new csv with each ``Segment`` on a new line.  Note that this function will not currently export user defined attributes that
are not inherently within a ``Segment`` object.  This function can be used as follows:

.. code:: python

    # Segments object
    segments

    # Export segments into a csv file
    distill.export_segments("./test.csv", segments)

The above code will create a csv file in the current directory entitled "test.csv".  An example of what this file looks
like with two ``Segment`` objects can be seen below:

.. code:: console

    Segment Name,Start Time,End Time,Number of Logs,Generate Field Name,Generate Matched Values,Segment Type
    segment1,0,1,5,type,['click'],Segment_Type.GENERATE
    segment2,2,3,6,type,['click'],Segment_Type.GENERATE

Visualization Examples
----------------------
One specific benefit of exporting ``Segment`` objects into a csv file is the ability for those ``Segment`` objects to be
visualized using pre-existing visualization software.  Through the returned csv file, we have been successful in building
visualizations through both Apache Superset and Plotly.  Below are example visualizations from each software:

Apache Superset
***************
By importing our ``Segment`` csv file, we can create a variety of useful visualizations with `Apache's Superset <https://superset.apache.org>`_.
Below are a few example screenshots from Superset:

**Pie Chart indicating the different Segment types.**

**Bar Chart indicating the number of Segment objects with a given number of logs.**

   :width: 700

**Timeline showing the Number of Logs by Segment start time.**

Plotly
******
`Plotly <https://plotly.com/python/>`_ is another visualization tool that can be used to generate useful graphs and charts.
One chart that we found particularly useful was the ability to visualize ``Segment`` objects within a Gantt chart.  Below
is an example use of this chart.

To create the chart, the following code can be used assuming a csv file entitled `example_segments.csv` exists in the current
directory and this file represents start and end times in the python ``datetime`` formatting:

.. code:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.express as px

    df = pd.read_csv("./example_segments.csv")
    fig = px.timeline(df, x_start="Start Time", x_end="End Time", y="Segment Name", color="Number of Logs")
    fig.update_yaxes(autorange="reversed")
    fig.show()

The above code will create a Gantt chart similar to the screenshot shown below:

.. image:: ./images/Gantt.png
   :width: 700

In addition, `Plotly's Dash <https://plotly.com/dash/>`_ can be used to create useful dashboards that display Plotly plots.  An example of this can be
seen in the video below:
