==================
Exporting Segments
==================
``Segments`` objects can be exported into csv files for further analysis.  Distill provides a simple function to do this:
``export_segments``.  This function will take in the path to place the new file along with a ``Segments`` object and output
a new csv with each ``Segment`` on a new line.  Note that this function will not currently export user defined attributes that
are not inherently within a ``Segment`` object.  This function can be used as follows:

.. code:: python

    # Segments object
    segments

    # Export segments into a csv file
    distill.export_segments("./test.csv", segments)

The above code will create a csv file in the current directory entitled "test.csv".  An example of what this file looks
like with two ``Segment`` objects can be seen below:

.. code:: console

    Segment Name,Start Time,End Time,Number of Logs,Generate Field Name,Generate Matched Values,Segment Type
    segment1,0,1,5,type,['click'],Segment_Type.GENERATE
    segment2,2,3,6,type,['click'],Segment_Type.GENERATE
