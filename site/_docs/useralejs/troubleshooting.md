### Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

The logs generated by [Apache UserALE.js](https://github.com/apache/flagon-useralejs) are sent to a logging server which is configured in the script tag or via .js scripts using our API. Your client may send out failure logs because of a CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) issue. You will need to configure your backend server to enable CORS.

For more information and examples on how to enable CORS on your server, please visit [enable-cors.org](http://enable-cors.org/index.html).
