description: Apache UserALE (User Analytic Logging Engine) is the beating heart of Apache Flagon technology. UserALE provides instrumentation for applications, embedding a light-weight, easy-to-manage behavioral logging capability. UserALE provides comprehensive user event tracking for web pages, but it is specially engineered for thin-client analytical applications. UserALE transmits specially structured messages from your application to an activity logging server whenever users interact with it. Apply UserALE with a single line of code and capture every user interaction without having to separately manage tags on each feature of your application. UserALE works with Elastic and other open source databasesâ€“you own your data and you can access it for analysis and automation without restriction. UserALE.js serves Javascript applications.
