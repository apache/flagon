description: Apache UserALE (User Analytic Logging Engine) is the beating heart of Apache SensSoft technology. UserALE provides instrumentation for applications, turning them into human use sensors. UserALE provides comprehensive user event tracking for web pages, but it is specially engineered for tools–applications users will use in their work. UserALE will transmit specially structured messages from your application to an activity logging server whenever your users interact with it. Apply UserALE with a single line of code and capture every user interaction without having to separately manage tags on each feature of your application. UserALE works with Elastic and other open source databases–you own your data and you can access it for analysis and automation without restriction. UserALE.js serves Javascript applications. For desktop applications written in PyQt5 see UserALE.PyQt5.
