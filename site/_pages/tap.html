description: Apache TAP (Test Application Portal) is a single point of entry into your SensSoft system. TAP features registration features served through Django–register your application, organization, and yourself to control access to your applications' usage data and manage custom configurations in TAP. TAP also provides you with a customizable array of interactive visual analytic libraries to extract insights from your usage data. You'll have many of the features you've come to rely on from other products–through TAP you can explore how users interact with each element of your application, and how they interacted with each of them. With TAP you'll also be able to visually compare usage between different segments of your user base and perform A/B usability testing between different versions of your application–you'll have access to any data you collect on your users and statistics, metrics or modeling output that is built into Distill. TAP also provides you with beautiful custom D3 visualizations of your users' workflows in your application. See how they do work with your application and learn how your application design augments their workflow or prevents them from discovering other features. TAP comes with many "out-of-the-box" features for extracting insight from usage data, but it is designed for customization.
