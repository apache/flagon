# Semantic {Component}

This repository contains pre-compiled {component} files using the default themes. This is intended for use in projects that do not need all the bells and whistles of Semantic UI, and want to keep file size to a minimum.

For the latest changes please see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/UI-{Component}/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md)

**Special Note**
An update in `2.0.8` has fixed an issue which may have prevented some single component modules from working correctly. Please see notes in [this pull request](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/pull/2816).
